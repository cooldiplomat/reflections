Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are copied github repositories in my github account.
- clones are copied github repositories in my local computer, or else it can be copy of my local repository in another location in my computer.
- branches are special way of making commits where the commits do not affect the master branch.
- I will prefer branches when I work in a new feature in my project without disrupting the master.
- I will prefer fork when I intend to work on another user's work.
- I will prefer clonning when I want to work locally rather than in github.
